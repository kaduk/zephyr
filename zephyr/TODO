Milestone 1 (done)
	  * client library uses as much krb5 as possible to talk to krb4
	  server, converting tickets and whatnot.  This will be mostly
	  ripped out, but serves as a proof of concept.  Client will
	  successfully receive new-style checksums, but this code won't be
	  tested for a while.

Milestone 2 (written, not tested)
	  * server will accept new-style checksums and authenticators, as
	  well as old-style.  It will never send them, and "bad things"
	  will happen if non-DES enctypes get used.
	  * Note that this will allow krb5 interrealm clients, and there
	  are no brain-dump issues to deal with.  This is aesthetically
	  unpleasing, however.

Milestone 3
	  * client sends only new-style messages

Milestone 3.5
	  * refactor checksumming code

Milestone 4
	  * server sends only newstyle messages, and can't brain dump the
	  new keys.  (this tests the codepath opened in milestone 1)

Milestone 5
	  * server can send new or old-style messages depending on how the
	  client subscribed.
	  * server can brain dump newstyle keys, and figure out whether
	  the rest of the federation speaks them.

Milestone 6
	  * zhm can figure out what sort of realm it's talking to, and
	  communicate this to the client.

Milestone 6.5
	  * Send this to Derrick.

Milestone 7
	  * brain dump via krb5, encrypted
	  (optional) brain dump to/from file

Milestone 8
	  * bring sourceforge up to date

Milestone 9
	  * cough up a release of sourceforge
